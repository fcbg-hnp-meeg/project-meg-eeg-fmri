    "### Explanation of the R Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data:**\n",
    "   - The function begins by loading POA (Point of Analysis) or wCOG (weighted Center of Gravity) data from an Excel file that contains pre-computed Euclidean distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Extraction:**\n",
    "   - EEG and MEG distances are separately loaded using the `prepare_modality_df` and `clean_column_names` functions from `statistical_zeros_analysis_utils.R`. This step is crucial for determining whether the mean of dEEG (or dMEG) significantly deviates from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Location Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Next, using the `compute_location_analysis` function from `statistical_zeros_analysis_utils.R`, the analysis is performed for each combination of time point (tp) and condition. The function applies a Multivariate Non-Parametric Test (either a sign test or signed rank test) with the `sr.loc.test` function from the `SpatialNP` package. This multivariate test assesses the location of one or more samples based on spatial signs or ranks. For a single sample, it tests the null hypothesis about a specific location. For multiple samples, it tests the null hypothesis that all samples have the same location.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results and Plotting:**\n",
    "   - The results from the dispersion tests are compiled into a DataFrame and saved as an Excel file in the specified `local_dir` directory. The file is named `all_subjects_analysis-POA/COG_modality_comparison_analysis-location.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameters:**\n",
    "   - The function allows for the specification of the following parameters:\n",
    "     - `nb_permu`: The number of permutations used in the dispersion test, which affects the robustness and accuracy of the p-value estimation.\n",
    "     - `null_value`: The value against which the dEEG (or dMEG) mean is compared during the analysis.\n",
    "     - `score`: Specifies the type of statistical test performed, which can be either 'sign' or 'rank'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **References:**\n",
    "   - For more information on the `sr.loc.test` function, refer to the [SpatialNP Documentation](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/SpatialNP/html/locationtests.html).\n",
    "   - For theoretical background on distance-based tests for multivariate dispersion, consult the following article:\n",
